Hello World
===========

For want of something to do during the holidays, I decided to start this blog.
This is just the mandatory 'Hello World' post. Much more is yet to come.
I won't stick to any one subject with this blog. Any and everything on my mind
will be posted here! I'll also try to be much less narcissistic here, than on
my website ;-) I don't want to make this an actual blog, with long essays and
posts. I'll use it as a mini-blog. Plus it's much easier to write stuff here, I
really don't want to install Wordpress or some other heavy framework.

*Update*
This post was written back when I had a separate blog and a website. I now only
have a blog.
