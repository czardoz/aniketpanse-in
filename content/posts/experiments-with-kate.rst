My Experiments with Kate
========================

Alright, so Kate (KDE Advanced Text Editor) is my new obsession.
I basically tried to get involved by fixing a 'Junior Job', but
in the end it turned out to be an external issue. So, I turned
to the plugins. There's a pretty nice how-to on the KDE Techbase,
but it's a bit old.

Now, C++ is not my language of choice, I must say. Give me Python
any day. Anyway, since I'm not very familiar with it, I thought
maybe I should use some IDE. Then followed 6 hours of trying to get
CMake working with Eclipse (I also messed up my Android ADT install
during this time, but that's another story!). So I turned to
QtCreator. Again, there's a lucid how-to on the Kate website, but it
fails to mention that running Kate from within QtCreator does not run
'kbuildsycoca4'. After that, I am currently stuck at getting my own
plugin to work (which is pretty much a copy of the hello world plugin).
I've also been getting a load of help on the IRC (thanks igli!).
Hopefully my plugin will be working by tomorrow. I should read CMake
documentation too.
